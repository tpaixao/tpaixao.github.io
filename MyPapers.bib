	abstract = {Author Summary Evolution has produced a remarkable diversity of living forms that manifests in qualitative differences as well as quantitative traits. An essential factor that underlies this variability is transcription factor binding sites, short pieces of DNA that control gene expression levels. Nevertheless, we lack a thorough theoretical understanding of the evolutionary times required for the appearance and disappearance of these sites. By combining a biophysically realistic model for how cells read out information in transcription factor binding sites with model for DNA sequence evolution, we explore these timescales and ask what factors crucially affect them. We find that the emergence of binding sites from a random sequence is generically slow under point and insertion/deletion mutational mechanisms. Strong selection, sufficient genomic sequence in which the sites can evolve, the existence of partially decayed old binding sites in the sequence, as well as certain biophysical mechanisms such as cooperativity, can accelerate the binding site gain times and make them consistent with the timescales suggested by comparative analyses of genomic data.},

	abstract = {The behaviour of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is typically analysed using simulation-based statistical testing-like methods. In this paper, we demonstrate that we can replace this approach by a formal verification-like method that gives higher assurance and scalability. We focus on Wagner’s weighted GRN model with varying weights, which is used in evolutionary biology. In the model, weight parameters represent the gene interaction strength that may change due to genetic mutations. For a property of interest, we synthesise the constraints over the parameter space that represent the set of GRNs satisfying the property. We experimentally show that our parameter synthesis procedure computes the mutational robustness of GRNs -an important problem of interest in evolutionary biology- more efficiently than the classical simulation method. We specify the property in linear temporal logics. We employ symbolic bounded model checking and SMT solving to compute the space of GRNs that satisfy the property, which amounts to synthesizing a set of linear constraints on the weights.},

	abstract = {TFs regulate gene expression by binding to specific sequences in the promoter regions of their target genes. Promoters often contain multiple copies of the same TF binding sites. How does this multiplicity evolve? One possibility is that individuals with multiple, redundant binding sites have higher fitness. However, nonadaptive processes are also likely to be important. Here, we develop a mathematical model of the evolution of TF binding sites to help us disentangle how different evolutionary mechanisms contribute to the evolution of binding site redundancy and multiplicity. We show that recombination is expected to promote the evolution of multiple binding sites. This prediction is corroborated by genome-wide data from yeast. Another important factor in the evolution of multiplicity predicted in our analysis is TF promiscuity, that is, the ability of a TF to bind to multiple sequences. In addition, our analysis indicated that direct selection can have large effects on the evolution of redundancy and multiplicity. Data from yeast identified selection for changes in expression level as a candidate mechanism for the evolution of multiple binding sites. We conclude that, although selection may play a major role in the evolution of multiplicity in regulatory regions, nonadaptive forces can also lead to high levels of multiplicity.},

	abstract = {Sex allocation theory has been remarkably successful at explaining the prevalence of even sex ratios in natural populations and at identifying specific conditions that can result in biased sex ratios. Much of this theory focuses on parental sex determination (SD) strategies. Here, we consider instead the evolutionary causes and consequences of mixed offspring SD strategies, in which the genotype of an individual determines not its sex, but the probability of developing one of multiple sexes. We find that alleles specifying mixed offspring SD strategies can generally outcompete alleles that specify pure strategies, but generate constraints that may prevent a population from reaching an even sex ratio. We use our model to analyze sex ratios in natural populations of Tetrahymena thermophila, a ciliate with seven sexes determined by mixed SD alleles. We show that probabilistic SD is sufficient to account for the occurrence of skewed sex ratios in natural populations of T. thermophila, provided that their effective population sizes are small. Our results highlight the importance of genetic drift in sex ratio evolution and suggest that mixed offspring SD strategies should be more common than currently thought.},

	doi = {7100057},
	abstract = {Gene expression from both parental alleles is beneficial by masking the effects of deleterious recessive mutations and by reducing the noise in gene expression in diploid organisms. However, a class of genes are expressed preferentially or strictly from a single allele. The selective advantage of avoiding biallelic expression is clear for allelic-excluded antigen receptor and odorant receptor genes, genes undergoing X-chromosome inactivation in females and parental genomic imprinted genes. In contrast, there is no clear biological rationale for the predominant and stochastic monoallelic expression of cytokine genes in the immune system, and the underlying mechanism is elusive and controversial. A clarification of the mechanism of predominant monoallelic expression would be instrumental in better understanding its eventual biological functional. This prompted the development of a quantitative framework that could describe the dynamics of the pattern of allele expression of the IL-10 gene, from which general quantitative insights could be gained. We report that the experimental observations on these patterns of allelic expression cannot be easily reconciled with a simple model of stochastic transcriptional activation, in which the two alleles are, at any time, equally competent for transcription. Instead, these observations call into action a general model of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation according to which the locus competence for transcription is dynamic, involving multiple, cooperative and stochastic modification steps. In this model, the probability that an allele becomes transcriptionally active is a function of the number of chromatin modifications that it accumulated. On the basis of the properties of this model, we argue that predominant monoallelic expression might have had no adaptive role, and may have evolved under indirect selection for low frequency of expressing cells.},

The mechanism underlying this process, known as self-tolerance, is hitherto unresolved but seems to involve the control of clonal expansion of autoreactive lymphocytes. This article reviews mathematical modeling of self-tolerance, addressing two specific hypotheses. The first hypothesis posits that self-tolerance is mediated by tuning of activation thresholds, which makes autoreactive T lymphocytes reversibly “anergic” and unable to proliferate. The second hypothesis posits that the proliferation of autoreactive T lymphocytes is instead controlled by specific regulatory T lymphocytes. Models representing the population dynamics of autoreactive T lymphocytes according to these two hypotheses were derived. For each model we identified how cell density affects tolerance, and predicted the corresponding phase spaces and bifurcations. We show that the simple induction of proliferative anergy, as modeled here, has a density dependence that is only partially compatible with adoptive transfers of tolerance, and that the models of tolerance mediated by specific regulatory T cells are closer to the observations.},

	abstract = {IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine, exerting major effects in the degree and quality of the immune response. Using a newly generated IL-10 reporter mouse model, which easily allows the study of IL-10 expression from each allele in a single cell, we report here for the first time that IL-10 is predominantly monoallelic expressed in CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, we have compelling evidence that this expression pattern is not due to parental imprinting, allelic exclusion, or strong allelic bias. Instead, our results support a stochastic regulation mechanism, in which the probability to initiate allelic transcription depends on the strength of TCR signaling and subsequent capacity to overcome restrictions imposed by chromatin hypoacetylation. In vivo Ag-experienced T cells show a higher basal probability to transcribe IL-10 when compared with naive cells, yet still show mostly monoallelic IL-10 expression. Finally, statistical analysis on allelic expression data shows transcriptional independence between both alleles. We conclude that CD4+ T cells have a low probability for IL-10 allelic activation resulting in a predominantly monoallelic expression pattern, and that IL-10 expression appears to be stochastically regulated by controlling the frequency of expressing cells, rather than absolute protein levels per cell.},

Despite their fundamental and potential clinical significance, regulatory T (TR) cells have not yet been incorporated in a coherent theory of the immune system. This article reviews experimental evidence and theoretical arguments supporting a model of TR cell dynamics, uncovering some of its most relevant biological implications. According to this model, the persistence and expansion of TR cell populations depend strictly on specific interactions they make with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and conventional effector T (TE) cells. This three-partner crossregulation imposes that TR cells feed on the specific autoimmune activities they suppress, with implications ranging from their interactions with other cells to their repertoire selection in the periphery and in the thymus, and to the relationship between these cells and the innate immune system. These implications stem from the basic prediction that the peripheral dynamics sort the CD4+ T-cell repertoire into two subsets: a less diverse set of small clones of autoreactive effector and regulatory cells that regulate each other’s growth, and a more diverse set of barely autoreactive TE cell clones, whose expansion is limited only by APC availability. It is argued that such partitioning of the repertoire sets the ground for self–non-self discrimination.},

	abstract = {Toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems are commonly found on bacterial plasmids. The antitoxin inhibits toxin activity unless the system is lost from the cell. Then the shorter lived antitoxin degrades and the cell becomes susceptible to the toxin. Selection for plasmid-encoded TA systems was initially thought to result from their reducing the number of plasmid-free cells arising during growth in monoculture. However, modelling and experiments have shown that this mechanism can only explain the success of plasmid TA systems under a restricted set of conditions. Previously, we have proposed and tested an alternative model explaining the success of plasmid TA systems as a consequence of competition occurring between plasmids during co-infection of bacterial hosts. Here, we test a further prediction of this model, that competition between plasmids will lead to the biased accumulation of TA systems on plasmids relative to chromosomes. Transposon-encoded TA systems were added to populations of plasmid-containing cells, such that TA systems could insert into either plasmids or chromosomes. These populations were enriched for transposon-containing cells and then incubated in environments that did, or did not, allow effective within-host plasmid competition to occur. Changes in the ratio of plasmid- to chromosome-encoded TA systems were monitored. In agreement with our model, we found that plasmid-encoded TA systems had a competitive advantage, but only when host cells were sensitive to the effect of TA systems. This result demonstrates that within-host competition between plasmids can select for TA systems.},

The framework we present here decomposes the evolutionary process into its several components in order to facilitate the identification of similarities between different models. In particular, we propose a classification of evolutionary operators based on the defining properties of the different components. We cast several commonly used operators from both fields into this common framework. Using this, we map different evolutionary and genetic algorithms to different evolutionary regimes and identify candidates with the most potential for the translation of results between the fields.

Although some argue that they are not of importance, because most variation is additive, others claim that their effect in the long term can be substantial. Here, we focus on the long-term effects of genetic interactions under directional selection assuming no mutation or dominance, and that epistasis is symmetrical overall. We ask by how much the mean of a complex trait can be increased by selection and analyze two extreme regimes, in which either drift or selection dominate the dynamics of allele frequencies. In both scenarios, epistatic interactions affect the long-term response to selection by modulating the additive genetic variance. When drift dominates, we extend Robertson’s [Robertson A (1960) Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 153(951):234−249] argument to show that, for any form of epistasis, the total response of a haploid population is proportional to the initial total genotypic variance. In contrast, the total response of a diploid population is increased by epistasis, for a given initial genotypic variance. When selection dominates, we show that the total selection response can only be increased by epistasis when some initially deleterious alleles become favored as the genetic background changes. We find a simple approximation for this effect and show that, in this regime, it is the structure of the genotype−phenotype map that matters and not the variance components of the population.},

In the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, mutations can accumulate in the germline genome without being exposed to selection. We have conducted a mutation accumulation (MA) experiment in this species. Assuming that all mutations are deleterious and have the same effect, we estimate that the deleterious mutation rate per haploid germline genome per generation is U = 0.0047 (95\% credible interval: 0.0015, 0.0125), and that germline mutations decrease fitness by s = 11\% when expressed in a homozygous state (95\% CI: 4.4\%, 27\%). We also estimate that deleterious mutations are partially recessive on average (h = 0.26; 95\% CI: –0.022, 0.62) and that the rate of lethal mutations is {\textless}10\% of the deleterious mutation rate. Comparisons between the observed evolutionary responses in the germline and somatic genomes and the results from individual-based simulations of MA suggest that the two genomes have similar mutational parameters. These are the first estimates of the deleterious mutation rate and fitness effects from the eukaryotic supergroup Chromalveolata and are within the range of those of other eukaryotes.},

Because of this, it has been suggested that the increase in production rate of genetic variation is itself an adaptation. Here, we use a mathematical model to test this hypothesis. We find that this hypothesis is plausible when the environment is variable enough such that populations do not experience particular stresses too often. We provide an explicit expression for the critical time interval between exposures and discuss its implication for the evolution of resistance. Our results highlight how and when this form of evolvability can evolve by natural selection.},

These two factors can be summarized by the fitness landscape. However, it would require testing all mutations in all backgrounds, making the definition and analysis of fitness landscapes mostly inaccessible. Instead of postulating a particular fitness landscape, we address this problem by considering general classes of landscapes and calculating an upper limit for the time it takes for a population to reach a fitness peak, circumventing the need to have full knowledge about the fitness landscape. We analyze populations in the weak-mutation regime and characterize the conditions that enable them to quickly reach the fitness peak as a function of the number of sites under selection. We show that for additive landscapes there is a critical selection strength enabling populations to reach high-fitness genotypes, regardless of the distribution of effects. This threshold scales with the number of sites under selection, effectively setting a limit to adaptation, and results from the inevitable increase in deleterious mutational pressure as the population adapts in a space of discrete genotypes. Furthermore, we show that for the class of all unimodal landscapes this condition is sufficient but not necessary for rapid adaptation, as in some highly epistatic landscapes the critical strength does not depend on the number of sites under selection; effectively removing this barrier to adaptation.},

We present a runtime comparison between the ea and two non-elitist nature-inspired algorithms, Strong Selection Weak Mutation (SSWM) and the Metropolis algorithm. While the (1+1) EA has to jump across the valley to a point of higher fitness because it does not accept decreasing moves, the non-elitist algorithms may cross the valley by accepting worsening moves. We show that while the runtime of the (1+1) EA algorithm depends critically on the length of the valley, the runtimes of the non-elitist algorithms depend crucially only on the depth of the valley. In particular, the expected runtime of both SSWM and Metropolis is polynomial in l and exponential in d while the (1+1) EA is efficient only for valleys of small length. Moreover, we show that both SSWM and Metropolis can also efficiently optimize a rugged function consisting of consecutive valleys.},

In the model, weight parameters represent the gene interaction strength that may change due to genetic mutations. For a property of interest, we synthesise the constraints over the parameter space that represent the set of GRNs satisfying the property. We experimentally show that our parameter synthesis procedure computes the mutational robustness of GRNs—an important problem of interest in evolutionary biology—more efficiently than the classical simulation method. We specify the property in linear temporal logic. We employ symbolic bounded model checking and SMT solving to compute the space of GRNs that satisfy the property, which amounts to synthesizing a set of linear constraints on the weights.},

However, it is known that if the alleles involved in a Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility (DMI) between two loci are neutral, the resulting reproductive isolation cannot be maintained in the presence of either mutation or gene flow. Here we show that speciation can emerge through the collective effects of multiple neutral DMIs that cannot, individually, cause speciation—a mechanism we call emergent speciation. We investigate emergent speciation using models of haploid holey adaptive landscapes—neutral networks—with recombination. We find that certain combinations of multiple neutral DMIs can lead to speciation. Furthermore, emergent speciation is a robust mechanism that can occur in the presence of migration, and of deviations from the assumptions of the neutral network model. Strong recombination and complex interactions between the DMI loci facilitate emergent speciation. These conditions are likely to occur in nature. We conclude that the interaction between DMIs may cause speciation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Author Summary{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Most species are kept distinct by incompatibilities between the genes they carry. These genetic incompatibilities cause hybrids between the species to have low fitness. Here we propose that combinations of several incompatibilities can collectively cause the origin of species, although they cannot do so acting alone—a mechanism we call emergent speciation. We use flat fitness landscapes with many holes in them to extend the classic Dobzhansky–Muller model, and capture the essence of the phenomenon. We find that emergent speciation can, indeed, occur through the combined effects of multiple genetic incompatibilities. Furthermore, the conditions that facilitate emergent speciation are likely to occur in nature.

However, if deprived of competent progenitors, the thymus can temporarily maintain thymopoiesis autonomously. This bears a heavy cost, because prolongation of thymus autonomy causes leukemia. Here, we show that, at an early stage, thymus autonomy relies on double-negative 3 early (DN3e) thymocytes that acquire stem-cell-like properties. Following competent progenitor deprivation, DN3e thymocytes become long lived, are required for thymus autonomy, differentiate in vivo, and include DNA-label-retaining cells. At the single-cell level, the transcriptional programs of thymopoiesis in autonomy and the steady state are similar. However, a new cell population emerges in autonomy that expresses an aberrant Notch target gene signature and bypasses the β-selection checkpoint. In summary, DN3e thymocytes have the potential to self-renew and differentiate in vivo if cell competition is impaired, but this generates atypical cells, probably the precursors of leukemia.},

This participatory research model serves as a solid basis for comprehensively leveraging collective intelligence by effectively incentivizing contributions from the crowd, such as intellectual property (IP), work, validation, assessment, infrastructure, education, assessment, governance, publication and promotion of projects. On the analogy of its current blockbusters like peer-to-peer structured decentralized finance (“DeFi”), blockchain technology can seminally enhance the efficiency of science and RTD initiatives, even permitting to fully stage operations as a chiefless Decentralised Autonomous Organization (DAOs).},

Some of these interactions such as those of transcription factors and promoters have been studied extensively. However, predicting phenotypes of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) remains a major challenge. Here, we use a well-defined synthetic GRN to study in Escherichia coli how network phenotypes depend on local genetic context, i.e. the genetic neighborhood of a transcription factor and its relative position. We show that one GRN with fixed topology can display not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different phenotypes, depending solely on the local genetic context of its components. Transcriptional read-through is the main molecular mechanism that places one transcriptional unit (TU) within two separate regulons without the need for complex regulatory sequences. We propose that relative order of individual TUs, with its potential for combinatorial complexity, plays an important role in shaping phenotypes of GRNs.},

	abstract = {Centrioles are structurally conserved organelles, composing both centrosomes and cilia. In animal cycling cells, centrioles often form through a highly characterized process termed canonical duplication. However, a large diversity of eukaryotes assemble centrioles de novo through uncharacterized pathways. This unexplored diversity is key to understanding centriole assembly mechanisms and how they evolved to assist specific cellular functions. Here, we show that, during spermatogenesis of the bryophyte Physcomitrium patens, centrioles are born as a co-axially oriented centriole pair united by a cartwheel. Interestingly, we observe that these centrioles are twisted in opposite orientations. Microtubules emanate from the bicentrioles, which localize to the spindle poles during cell division. After their separation, the two resulting sister centrioles mature asymmetrically, elongating specific microtubule triplets and a naked cartwheel. Subsequently, two motile cilia are assembled that appear to alternate between different motility patterns. We further show that centriolar components SAS6, Bld10, and POC1, which are conserved across eukaryotes, are expressed during spermatogenesis and required for this de novo biogenesis pathway. Our work supports a scenario where centriole biogenesis, while driven by conserved molecular modules, is more diverse than previously thought.},

	abstract = {Sociality is often seen as a single phenotypic trait, but it relies on motivational and cognitive components implemented by specific causal mechanisms. Hence, these components may have evolved independently, or may have been linked by phenotypic correlations driven by a shared selective pressure for increased social competence. Furthermore, these components may be domain-specific or of general domain across social and non-social contexts. Here we have characterized the phenotypic architecture of sociality in zebrafish, which has been increasingly used as a model organism in social neuroscience. For this purpose, we have behaviorally phenotyped zebrafish from different wild type lines in four tests: social tendency, social and non-social recognition, and open-field test. Our results indicate that: (1) sociality has two main components that are independent from each other (social tendency and social recognition), hence not supporting the occurrence of a sociality syndrome; (2) both social traits are phenotypically linked to non-social traits (non-social exploration and non-social memory, respectively), forming two general behavioral modules, general inspection and general recognition, and suggesting that sociality traits have been co-opted from general-domain motivational and cognitive traits. Moreover, the study of the association between genetic polymorphisms (i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) and each behavioral module further supports this view, since several SNPs from a list of candidate “social” genes, are statistically associated with the general inspection (motivational), but not with a general recognition (cognitive), behavioral module. The SNPs associated with general inspection are widespread across different chromosomes and include neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and synaptic plasticity genes, suggesting that this behavioral module is regulated by multiple genes, each of them with small effects. Together, these results support the occurrence of general domain motivational and cognitive behavioral modules in zebrafish, which have been co-opted for the social domain.
Author summary Social living has been considered one of the major transitions in evolution and it has been considered to act as a major selective force shaping the evolution of brain and behavior in animals. Sociality relies on two basic behavioral mechanisms: (1) the willingness to approach and be near others (aka social tendency); and (2) the ability to distinguish between others (aka social recognition) in order to adjust the behavior expressed during social interactions according to the identity of the interactant. There is an ongoing debate on to what extent these social abilities have specifically evolved in response to social living and are domain specific, or if they were selected as a broad response to cognitive demands and are of general domain. Here, we used zebrafish to test the domain-specific vs. general domain hypotheses and to assess the association of social tendency and social recognition with a set of candidate “social” genes (i.e. genes that have been linked to social behavior in other studies with different vertebrate species). We found that both social traits are not correlated to each other and are of general domain, and that only social tendency is associated with candidate “social” genes, suggesting that social tendency and social recognition are independent behavioral modules that rely on separate genetic architectures and that can evolve separately.},

	abstract = {Anemia is a clinical hallmark and independent risk factor of malaria mortality, the disease caused by Plasmodium spp. infection. While malarial anemia arises from parasite-induced hemolysis, whether and how host metabolic adaptation to malaria regulates anemia severity is less understood. Here we demonstrate that reprogramming of organismal iron (Fe) metabolism by the kidneys is a central component of the host metabolic response regulating the pathogenesis of life-threatening malarial anemia. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) are the main cell compartment responsible for Fe storage and recycling during Plasmodium infection in mice. Transcriptional reprogramming of RPTEC couples immune resistance to Plasmodium infection to renal Fe export via the induction of the cellular Fe exporter SLC40A1/ferroportin 1. This integrated defense strategy is essential to deliver Fe to erythroblasts and support compensatory erythropoiesis to prevent the development of life-threatening anemia. Failure to mobilize Fe from RPTEC causes acute kidney injury (AKI) and is associated with life-threatening anemia in P. falciparum-infected individuals. These findings reveal an unexpected role of the kidneys in the control of organismal Fe metabolism and anemia severity during malaria.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: 
        The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is a predictor of mortality in ICU patients. Although it is widely used and has been validated as a reliable and independent predictor of mortality and morbidity in cardiac ICU, few studies correlate early postoperative SOFA with long-term survival.
        DESIGN: 
        Retrospective observational cohort study.
        SETTING: 
        Tertiary academic cardiac surgery ICU.
        PATIENTS: 
        One-thousand three-hundred seventy-nine patients submitted to cardiac surgery.
        INTERVENTIONS: 
        SOFA 24 hours, SOFA 48 hours, mean, and highest SOFA scores were correlated with survival at 12 and 24 months. Wilcoxon tests were used to analyze differences in variables. Multivariate logistic regressions and likelihood ratio test were used to access the predictive modeling. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess accuracy of the variables in separating survivor from nonsurvivors.
        MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
        Lower SOFA scores have better survival rates at 12 and 24 months. Highest SOFA and SOFA at 48 hours showed to be better predictors of outcome and to have higher accuracy in distinguishing survivors from nonsurvivors than initial SOFA and mean SOFA. A decreasing score during the first 48 hours had mortality rates of 4.9\%, while an unchanged or increased score was associated with a mortality rate of 5.7\%.
        CONCLUSIONS: 
        SOFA score in the ICU after cardiac surgery correlated with survival at 12 and 24 months. Patients with lower SOFA scores had higher survival rates. Differences in survival at 12 months were better correlated with the absolute value at 48 hours than with its variation. SOFA score may be useful to predict long-term outcomes and to stratify patients with higher probability of mortality.},

	abstract = {Iron recycling prevents the development of anemia under homeostatic conditions. Whether iron recycling was co-opted as a defense strategy to prevent the development of anemia in response to infection is unclear. We ﬁnd that in severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the onset of life-threatening anemia is associated with acute kidney injury (AKI), irrespective of parasite load. Using a well-established experimental rodent model of malaria anemia, we identify a transcriptional response that endows renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) with the capacity to store and recycle iron during P. chabaudi chabaudi (Pcc) infection. This response encompasses the induction of ferroportin 1/SLC40A1, which exports iron from RPTECs and counteracts AKI while supporting compensatory erythropoiesis and preventing the onset of life-threatening malarial anemia. Iron recycling by myeloid cells is dispensable to this protective response, suggesting that RPTECs provide an iron-recycling salvage pathway that prevents the pathogenesis of life-threatening malarial anemia.},

	abstract = {Hypoglycemia is a clinical hallmark of severe malaria, the often-lethal outcome of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Here, we report that malaria-associated hypoglycemia emerges from a non-canonical resistance mechanism, whereby the infected host reduces glycemia to starve Plasmodium. This hypometabolic response is elicited by labile heme, a byproduct of hemolysis that induces illness-induced anorexia and represses hepatic glucose production. While transient repression of hepatic glucose production prevents unfettered immune-mediated inflammation, organ damage, and anemia, when sustained over time it leads to hypoglycemia, compromising host energy expenditure and adaptive thermoregulation. The latter arrests the development of asexual stages of Plasmodium via a mechanism associated with parasite mitochondrial dysfunction. In response, Plasmodium activates a transcriptional program associated with the reduction of virulence and sexual differentiation toward the generation of transmissible gametocytes. In conclusion, malaria-associated hypoglycemia represents a trade-off of a hypometabolic-based defense strategy that balances parasite virulence versus transmission.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: 
        Cardiac surgery is frequently associated with significant postoperative bleeding. Platelet-dysfunction is the main cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-induced hemostatic defect. Not only the number of platelets decreases, but also the remaining are functionally impaired. Although lipid metabolism is crucial for platelet function, little is known regarding platelet metabolic changes associated with CPB-dysfunction. Our aim is to explore possible contribution of metabolic perturbations for platelet dysfunction after cardiac surgery.
        DESIGN: 
        Prospective cohort study.
        SETTING: 
        Tertiary academic cardiothoracic-surgery ICU.
        PATIENTS: 
        Thirty-three patients submitted to elective surgical aortic valve replacement.
        INTERVENTIONS: 
        Samples from patients were collected at three time points (preoperative, 6- and 24-hr postoperative). Untargeted metabolic analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed to compare patients with significant postoperative bleeding with patients without hemorrhage. Principal component analyses, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests, adjusted to FDR, and pairwise comparison were used to identify pathways of interest. Enrichment and pathway metabolomic complemented the analyses.
        MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
        We identified a platelet-related signature based on an overrepresentation of changes in known fatty acid metabolism pathways involved in platelet function. We observed that arachidonic acid (AA) levels and other metabolites from the pathway were reduced at 6 and 24 hours, independently from antiagreggation therapy and platelet count. Concentrations of preoperative AA were inversely correlated with postoperative chest tube blood loss but were not correlated with platelet count in the preoperative, at 6 or at 24 hours. Patients with significant postoperative blood-loss had considerably lower values of AA and higher transfusion rates. Values of postoperative interleukin-6 were strongly correlated with AA variability.
        CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
        Our observations suggest that an inflammatory-related perturbation of AA metabolism is a signature of cardiac surgery with CPB and that preoperative levels of AA may be more relevant than platelet count to anticipate and prevent postoperative blood loss in patients submitted to cardiac surgery with CPB.},
